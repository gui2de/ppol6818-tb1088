Hello! My name is Tianyu Bai. I am a second-year MIDP student with a strong interest in **impact evaluation, development economics, and data analysis**.  
I spent my summer in Nairobi, Kenya, working on cash transfer programs for refugees and even picked up some Swahili along the way! I also planned and went on a lot of safari trip after my internship—because why work in Kenya without seeing some lions and elephants? 🦁🐘 HAHA! I really loved Kenya and I’ll definitely come back again if I have the chance!
